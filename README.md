# TechDeals eCommerce Analysis
Founded in 2018, TechDeals is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products to a global customer base. TechDeals sells products through their online site as well as through their mobile app, and they use a variety of marketing channels to reach customers, including Email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate links.

To prepare for a company-wide town hall, a key stakeholder at TechDeals has asked for insights & recommendations based on a dataset of 108k+ customer transactions spanning from 2019-2022.

# About the Data

An ERD detailing the structure of the dataset can be found below. As each record in the "orders" table represents a unique order, the table grain is order ID.

Before analysis, additional steps were taken to process the data and address issues including missing values and inconsistent formatting. A log detailing these steps can be found at the bottom of this document.

# Summary of Insights

- [ ]  Summary follows this order: Context & Data → Insights & Recommendations → Technical Process
- [ ]  Include a visual that shows graphs, pivot tables, or dashboard

- [ ]  - Projects are stored in GitHub with a concise ReadMe containing 1) a quick overview, 2) a visual, 3) insights, and 4) recommendations; requires no scrolling to get to the “so what” of the project
- [ ]  Projects use an actual sample company name to represent company relevance (note: “Elist Post-Pandemic Analysis” would have been a better title than “Post-Pandemic E-commerce Analysis)
